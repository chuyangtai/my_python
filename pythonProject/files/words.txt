
Cardiff Council published its notice of approval on Friday, July 26. In their 2023 planning statement, Rightacres highlighted the Scott Harbour redevelopment as an opportunity to "reinvigorate a vacant office building that is demonstrating no market interest into much-needed residential accommodation".

The developer's statement further notes that the future occupants will benefit from both private and shared amenity spaces, alongside cafes and an "excellent aspect on to Cardiff Bay". According to Land Registry records, Rightacres acquired Scott Harbour in January 2024 for a sum of Â£4.5 million.
